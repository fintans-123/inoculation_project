# Introduction

All code here relates to my project developing and testing the effectiveness of an intervention at reducing self-reported engagement with stories on social media
that derogate political outgroups. I am currently preparing this project for publication. 

# Analyses

To assess effects, analysis of variance, linear regression models, mediation analysis and logistic regression models are employed. The code for analyses and wrangling
for these analyses can be found in 'Clean_analysis_script_it2_git.R'. Code for visualisation of effects is also included here. In places this code may be a bit untidy - analysis is still ongoing for this project, so please forgive any messiness for the time being!
